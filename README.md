# Back Pocket Games

Working with groups of children can be stressful for many reasons. One reason is the spontaneous need to quickly organize an activity to entertain a group. My app will alleviate the stress from that situation by putting games in your back pocket. Users choose from a few options and the app quickly generates games based on those preferences.
