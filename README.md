# Back Pocket Games

Back Pocket Games uses MongoDB as the database, Rails as the backend api where all the games live, and Angular 2 on the front end.

This is the Rails api that serves my [Angular 2 App](https://github.com/rmtolmach/frontpocket) which generates and filters games. See that repo for more details.
